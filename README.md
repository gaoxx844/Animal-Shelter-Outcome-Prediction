Animal-Shelter-Outcome-Prediction
Introduction:
Every year, approximately 7.6 million companion animals end up in US shelters. 
Many animals are given up as unwanted by their owners, while others are picked up after getting lost or taken out of cruelty situations. 
Many of these animals find forever families to take them home, but just as many are not so lucky. 
2.7 million dogs and cats are euthanized in the US every year.

Using a dataset of intake information including breed, color, sex, and age from the Austin Animal Center, we're asking Kagglers to predict the outcome for each animal.

In the train dataset, there are 26729 cases been recorded with descriptive features as following:
Datetime of intake from 2013-10-01 to 2016-2-21 
Animal types in dogs and cats
Sex in: Neutered Male, Spayed Female, Intact Male, Intact Female and Unknown
Age in years, month or week units
Breed Type and color

The goal of this prediction is to forecast each animal's end going  
with probability of falling into Return_to_owner, Euthanasia, Adoption, Transfer or Died
